	<h3>Try it Yourself!</h3>
	<p>I realized that a lot of the code in this project only sends me texts, which just seems unfair. And unverifiable.</p>
	<p>So I decided to add this section of the app to send compliments to my visitors. It just seemed fair.</p>
	<p>If you would like to see my code work in real life, enter your mobile phone number (it isn't stored in my database), and get a compliment via text.</p>
	<form action="/send_text">
		<p>Phone Number:</p>
		<input type="text", name="phone_number", value="15551234567">
		<input type="submit", name="Submit">
	</form>
